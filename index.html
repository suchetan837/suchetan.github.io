            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural
            achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its
            recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids
            and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and
            domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. Not a piece of
            architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an
            emperor’s love wrought in living stones.
            
            The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[11] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.
            The Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors in 2001,[57] which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014.[3] A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. In 2018, the fee for Indian citizens was 50 INR, for foreign tourists 1,100 INR.[58] Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre.[59][60] In 2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours
